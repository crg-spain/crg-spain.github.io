I share my experience throughout academia using quite primitive algorithm,
randomly choosing emails from data I can reach using open data retrieval tools.

I do this because:

1. I want to create a precedent which would restrict (knowing that it can become public) senior academia staff from suppressing and manipulating their younger and more vulnerable colleagues, when seniors pursue their murky purposes which usually include but not limited to data manipulation.

2. Intimidated academia folks should have definite tools to protect themselves and their right for job in research without any risk for their well-being, as they depend too much on seniors due to the network of recommendations and research funding.
At least they have to find a way to safely share their experience and ideally â€” get real support.

Sorry if this bored you.
