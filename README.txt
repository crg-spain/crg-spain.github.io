Summarizing all the story in the anecdote:

Luis Serrano, CRG:
 — what maria proposed does not make any sense.

Maria:
 — she does not obey to do what I propose!

Luis Serrano & M Lluch-Senar
(both very «con tensiones en la empresa por ello»):
 — you are fired!

 — Yet another milestone in (EU) science — «researchers» reasoning is made up to be supported by the Court.
But all glory to Spanish/Catalan science, of course.
